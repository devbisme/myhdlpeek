The following Jupyter notebooks will illustrate how to use myhdlpeek.
Unfortunately, Github doesn't render the waveform displays so you'll have to
download and run the notebooks locally to see what myhdlpeek can do.

* `Simple multiplexer.   <https://github.com/xesscorp/myhdlpeek/blob/master/examples/peeker_simple_mux.ipynb>`_
* `Hierarchical adder.   <https://github.com/xesscorp/myhdlpeek/blob/master/examples/peeker_hier_add.ipynb>`_
